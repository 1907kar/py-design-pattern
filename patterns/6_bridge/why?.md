## Why?
1. Incase of multiple permutation and combination of class and objects, we can streamline by creating an abstract base class and passing it as argument to the other class. This is the bridge.
    1. For ex, if we have two ways to draw shapes such as cartesian and raster. Shapes can be any such as circle, square..etc
    2. By this, 
        1. if we consider for circle, we need create two class one for cartesian circle, raster circle
        2. if we consider for square, we need create two class one for cartesian square, raster triangle
